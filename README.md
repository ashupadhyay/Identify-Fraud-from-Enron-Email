# Identify-Fraud-from-Enron-Email

## Project Overview
In this project, I played the role of a detective, and put my machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, you will play detective, and put your new skills to use by building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. To assist you in your detective work, we've combined this data with a hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case, which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.

## Why this Project?
This project taught me the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.

It taught me you how to extract and identify useful features that best represent the data, a few of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms today, and how to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms.

## What will I learn?
By the end of the project, was able to:

- Deal with an imperfect, real-world dataset
- Validate a machine learning result using test data
- Evaluate a machine learning result using quantitative metrics
- Create, select and transform features
- Compare the performance of machine learning algorithms
- Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance
- Communicate your machine learning algorithm results clearly

## Why is this Important to my Career?
Machine learning is a first-class ticket to the most exciting careers in data analysis today. As data sources proliferate along with the computing power to process them, going straight to the data is one of the most straightforward ways to quickly gain insights and make predictions.

In this project, while working with a real dataset that, by itself, had existed almost stagnantly for years. However, through using machine learning and data science, the insights drawn from this data had a huge impact on a corporation and the economy.
